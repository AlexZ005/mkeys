# mkeys
mkeys is a lightweight script to simulate mouse buttons by mapping them to ZXC keyboard buttons.

Using alternatives such as combination of xbindkeys and xte does not fully simulate mouse buttons.

xdotool also is a great alternative, but it have the same behaviour when it comes to simulate hold/drag'n'drop with mouse.

This script uses xmodmap and xkbset to modify keymap and mousekeys.
